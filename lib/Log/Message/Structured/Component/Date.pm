=head1 NAME

Log::Message::Structured::Component::Date

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyLogEvent;
    use Moose;
    use namespace::autoclean;

    # Note: you MUST compose these together as they depend on methods in each other
    with qw/
        Log::Message::Structured
    /;
    # Components must be consumed seperately
    with qw/
        Log::Message::Structured::Component::Date
    /;

    has foo => ( is => 'ro', required => 1 );

    ... elsewhere ...

    use aliased 'My::Log::Event';

    $logger->log(message => Event->new( foo => "bar" ));
    # Logs:
    {"__CLASS__":"MyLogEvent","foo":1,"date":"2010-03-28T23:15:52Z"}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides a C<'date'> attribute to the consuming class ( probably
L<Log::Message::Structured>), representing the epoch time in ISO8601.

Requires the C<epochtime> attribute (L<Log::Message::Structured> provides it).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 BUILD

An empty build method (which will be silently discarded if you have one in your class) is provided,
and is wrapped to make sure the date is inflated at construction time.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head1 date

The date and time on which the event occured, as an ISO8601 date time string
(from L<MooseX::Types::ISO8601>). Defaults to the time the object is
constructed.
