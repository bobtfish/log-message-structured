        Log::Message::Structured::Component::Date

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides C<'epochtime'> and C<'date'> attributes to the consuming class ( that should also
consume L<Log::Message::Structured>).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 BUILD

The BUILD method is wrapped to make sure the date is inflated at
construction time.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 date

The date and time on which the event occured, as an ISO8601 date time string
(from L<MooseX::Types::ISO8601>). Defaults to the time the object is
constructed.

=head2 epochtime

The date and time on which the event occurred, as the number of seconds since Jan.
1st, 1970 (i.e. the output of C<time()>). Defaults to the time the object is
constructed.
